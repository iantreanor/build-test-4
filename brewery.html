 <h2>Black Sheep Brewery</h2>
<div>
  <p>Black Sheep was born from the pioneering spirit of Paul Theakston who, in 1992, followed his heart and dared to start a new brewery.</p>

<p>Set in Masham, North Yorkshire, Black Sheep produces much loved cask, keg and bottled beers and continues to go against the grain with a 
flow of new and experimental brews.</p>

<p>Each beer is the culmination of brewing expertise spanning six family generations.</p>

<p>Today, Paul's sons Rob and Jo Theakston continue that spirit as Black Sheep stands tall amongst UK breweries, built on a solid reputation 
for creating beer of outstanding quality full of passion and integrity.</p>

  <h2>Dark Star Brewery</h2>
<div>
  <p>As a rule we don't make things easy for ourselves. </p>
  <p>We started life back in 1994 in the cellar of The Evening Star pub in Brighton   with a brew kit marginally bigger that that used by an 
  enthusiastic home brewer. </p>
  <p>Our love of American hops that has shaped the beers   we've become known for, started when our Chairman, Peter Halliday, returned from a 
  business trip across the pond with a suitcase full of hops -   we all still agree that he did well to get through customs with his vegetation. 
  We're a bit bigger than that now and use a few more hops, but the   free spirited nature still very much holds true.</p>
